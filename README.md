iplant_upload
=============

A repo detailing commands for moving data from the Berkely FTP server to implant data store, via Atmosphere. 

This process is somewhat confusing for users who are not familiar with iPlant Atmosphere or FTP. This is my attempt to:
<br>
[1] document what commands I have used and keep track of the most efficient method for moving data between iPlant and the FTP server.
<br>
[2] Hompefully provide at rough guide to other users in the RILAB to aid in transfer of data in the future.
